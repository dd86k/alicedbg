/// The ptrace() system call provides a means by which one process (the
/// "tracer") may observe and control the execution of another process
/// (the "tracee"), and examine and change the tracee's memory and
/// registers.  It is primarily used to implement breakpoint debugging
/// and system call tracing.
///
/// Although arguments to ptrace() are interpreted according to the
/// prototype given, glibc currently declares ptrace() as a variadic
/// function with only the request argument fixed.  It is recommended
/// to always supply four arguments, even if the requested operation
/// does not use them, setting unused/ignored arguments to 0L or
/// (void *) 0.
/// 
/// Params:
/// 	req = PTRACE request
/// 	pid = Process ID number
/// 	addr = Memory pointer
/// 	data = Data pointer
/// 
/// Returns: 0 on success; -1 on error. For PT_PEEK requests, check errno
/// first
