/**
 * Missing or incorrect core.stdc.stdio definitions.
 *
 * For example, when compiled with -betterC, `putchar` from core.stdc.stdio
 * still mangles to `_D4core4stdc5stdio7putcharFiZi` due to the D extern, so
 * the function links up with the version from the druntime (or itself).
 * On top of that, stdout isn't initialized since that's done in the Druntime.
 * So when executed, boom, crash.
