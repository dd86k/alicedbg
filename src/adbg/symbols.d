/// Dynamic library loader.

/// Shared libraries are often known as Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) on Windows
/// and Shared Objects (SO) on POSIX platforms.
/// 
/// This is an enhancement made to fix some annoying BindBC issues.
/// The structure is kept under 4 KiB per instance with static buffers.
///
/// Issue 1: Assertion usage.
/// On error, debug builds stop the whole program on an assertion performed
/// against user data. Unoptimal for optional features.
/// 
/// Issue 2: Error handling.
/// On error, errorCount or SharedLib both need to be checked. Creates pitfalls.
/// This also allocates memory using malloc which is never freed.
