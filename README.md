# Alice Debugger Project

⚠️ **Early development!** ⚠️

The alicedbg project aims to be a simple debugger, object dumper, and system
tracer. Either as a stand-alone program or as a library.

Currently, it supports:
- Windows (msvcrt) and Linux (Glibc and Musl) debugging.
- x86-16, x86-32, and x86-64 disassembly.
- The Intel, Nasm, and AT&T syntaxes.
- ELF and PE32 image dumping.
- Stand-alone application and DUB integration as a library, both betterC-compatible.
- Fully supports DMD, GDC, and LDC as much as possible.
- 2 debugger user interfaces.

All written from scratch for me to learn various internal mechanics.
