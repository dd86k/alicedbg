# Alice Debugger Project

⚠️ **Early development!** ⚠️

The alicedbg project aims to be a simple debugger, object dumper, and system
tracer fully compatible with -betterC/-fno-druntime.

It is available as an application and as a DUB library.

The library supports:
- Windows (msvcrt) and Linux (Glibc and Musl) debugging.
- x86-16, x86-32, and x86-64 disassembly.
- The Intel, Nasm, and AT&T, HLA, and TASM syntaxes.
- DMD, GDC, and LDC compilers.

The application supports:
- ELF and PE32 image dumping.
- looping and command-line debugger user interfaces.

⚠️: Currently not accepting Pull Requests.
All written from scratch for me to learn various internal mechanics.
