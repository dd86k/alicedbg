# Alice Debugger Project

⚠️ **Early development!** ⚠️

The alicedbg project aims to be an easy-to-use, simple debugger, object dumper,
and profiler. Either as a stand-alone program or as a library.

_Why not just use GDB or LLDB?_ One might ask.

_Why not make one from scratch myself?_ I asked myself.

Most of the help topics can be found in the repository Wiki.

Manual: To be announced
